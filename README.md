## Purpose
This collection of scripts should be useful for those wishing to create a MySQL database connection and stream data using
functions from the twitter API.

3. Run the SQL script to create the appropriate table for storing the data

## Streaming the data
1. Change the necessary variables for personal credentials in the python script
2. Run the script
